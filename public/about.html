<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm a beginner web developer with a passion for learning and creating. After exploring different fields, I found my true interest in web development. I'm currently honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and working on building responsive and user-friendly websites.</p>

<p>As someone who loves problem-solving and bringing ideas to life through code, I’m excited to continue expanding my knowledge and tackling new challenges. This website showcases some of my projects as I develop my portfolio, and I look forward to learning, growing, and connecting with others in the web development community.</p>
  
<p>Thanks for stopping by—feel free to reach out or check out my work!</p>
